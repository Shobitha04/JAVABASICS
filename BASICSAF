Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language.
James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle Corporation) designed it, and it was released in 1995.
The language was developed with the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) philosophy. This principle underscores Java's key feature - platform independence
 allowing the same Java program to run on multiple platforms without modifications.

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) - This is the heart of our program, where the execution begins.
